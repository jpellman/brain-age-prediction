Supekar et al. (2009) uses a variety of graph-based methods in an exploratory way to characterize connectivity patterns between children (7-9) and adults (19-22).  They used resting-state only scans to calculate path lengths, clustering coefficients, degree/small-worldness, global efficiency, and hierarchical organization for 5 a priori regions (association, limbic, paralimbic, primary, subcortical).
