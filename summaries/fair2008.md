Fair et al (2008) focuses on the developmental trajectory of the DMN in a manner complementary to Fair et al (2007)'s treatment of task-related networks. It begins by discussing the putative function of the DMN (introspection) and the mPFC (narrative), a consitituent region.  It discusses evidence from non-imaging studies that certain abilities (episodic memory, theory of mind, mentalization) appear at specific developmental stages and suggests that these stages should be able to be investigated with neuroimaging.  The study then presents results from voxelwise connectivity maps and graphs based on a sample of 210 participants. The connectivity maps demonstrated that the ventral mPFC was strongly connected with other regions in adults and more weakly connected in children.  The graph analysis used 13 a priori DMN/task-negative regions from adult studies and found that the DMN was highly integrated in adults and more weakly-connected in children overall.  The study concludes that the DMN progressively becomes more integrated with age.  Some points the authors discussed were: the possibility of the DMN manifesting itself differently in children than adults (i.e., having different ROIs) as an unlikely caveat,  the role of myelination and spontaneous brain activity, the development of strategies/expertise that strengthen adult structures that are established in childhood.
