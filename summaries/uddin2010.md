# Summary of "Typical and atypical development of functional human brain networks: insights from resting-state fMRI", Uddin et al., Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, 2010

rs-fMRI applied to the study of developmental trajectories has generally found that neural activity becomes more focal and less diffuse as people age.  Popular techniques used to analyzed develomental data include seed-based analyses, ICA and graph analysis.  In infants/young children, sensorimotor system connectivity precedes visual network connectivity and higher cognition, the DMN is not developed, and intrahemispheric connectivity is greater than interhemispheric connectivity.  This age group also lacks the small-world architecture associated with older adults.  Methods for working with this age group include scanning while participants are sedated or asleep, with a strong preference for using natural sleep instead of sedation.  Adolescents/young adults generally have decreased connectivity along the anterior-posterior direction, but adult-like patterns of interhemispheric connectivity.

 * A PCC/Rsp (retrosplenial) node is consistently observed to have high centrality measures across ages.
 
## Adolescents and Young Adults
* ICA-based analyses
 * Aging --> stronger within-network connections, more pruned between-network connections; two-way causality decreases with age; Granger causality
* Graph/network analysis
 * "Segregation" (decrease in connectivity) in spatially close regions, "integration" (increase in connectivity) between distant regions occur with aging
 * Local architecture in kids --> distributed architecture in adults
 * More segregation in children, more integration in adults at whole-brain level
 * Overall, sub-networks of densely-connected nodes; small-world architecture in both 7-9 yo and 19-22 yo

## Neurodevelopmental Disorders
* ADHD
 * Decreases in - correlations between anterio cingulate and precuneus/PCC
 * Dcreases in connectivity between precuneus and DMN
* ASD
 * Overall reduced DMN connectivity
 * Repetitive behaviors correlated with connectivity between PCC and parahippocampal gyrus
 * Adolescents with ASD have weaker DMN connectivity than adults with ASD

## Considerations/Future Directions
* Are differences noted due to individual performance differences or due to brain maturation?  Must tease apart within-subject effects and age-related effects.
* Motion - potential solutions
 * Mock scanner
 * Artifact correction
 * ICA
* Nonstandard instructions for rsfMRI
 * Close eyes
 * Fixation
 * No fixation
* Do "rest blocks" in task block designs accurately reflect non-task rs data?
* How reproducible are networks in developing participants?
 * DMN is very reproducible, non-DMN not so much
* Statistical Power and Sampling
 * Power calculations should be done
 * Clinical and control groups should be homogeneous
* Nuisance corrections
* Could integrate DTI w/ rsfMRI.
* Could integrate genetics data with rsfMRI.
