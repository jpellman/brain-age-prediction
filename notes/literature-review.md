## An Overview: The importance of brain developmental trajectories (by James Pooley)

![Examples of Neurodevelopmental Trajectories](trajectories.jpg)

* Many psychiatric conditions now viewed as neurodevelopmental disorders.
* The promise of mental "growth charts" is personalized "interventions at
  the developmental trajectory itself, rather than at cross-sectional symptoms." Focusing on the trajectory rather than the symptoms is important since clinical signs and symptoms often appear "relatively late in the disease process."
* Obtaining and working with longitudinal datasets involving neonatal, infant, pediatric, and
  adolescent populations is challenging, and even more so when dealing with
  subpopulations with psychiatric conditions.
* Good stuff on the challenges (and importance of addressing these challenges) involved with using pediatric populations in imaging studies is

> Mental illnesses are disorders of life trajectories beginning before birth and extending into older age. Longitudinal trajectory-based studies of the origins of mental illness during early development are the key to better diagnostic 
and treatment tools for mentally ill patients. Had researchers taken a cross-
sectional approach, they might
 not have found the important 
link between genetic variation, clinical outcome, and cortical
 thickness in ADHD presented 
in Section I. Variation between individuals 
can mask detection of subtle, but potentially 
important developmental shifts within individuals over time. While cross group 
comparisons at set time points can address mechanisms 
of development, they detect 
developmental dynamics that may be critical but
 variable across individuals. Longitudinal 
studies involve examining changes in behavior and brain processes over a developmental 
course within individuals, and can identify 
change within a developmental process or 
clinical symptom and link it to genetic de
terminants and neural correlates. Looking 
longitudinally, particularly over key transition 
points, may help elucidate the similarities 
and differences between periods
 of development, and determine which periods are more 
vulnerable to disruption. Longitudinal analyses 
could also have important implications in 
therapeutic decisions (e.g., whether a mental illness should be treated similarly in children 
and adults), and could help clinicians devel
op individualized treatment, taking into account 
not only the trajectory of healthy development, but also adapting treatments to a patient's 
individual circumstances. Finally, longitudinal studies of high-risk individuals that do not 
develop psychopathology may be valuable in elucidating protective factors, and serve as the 
basis for developing novel therapeutics. 
>
> Ultimately, the goal of research in this ne
w field is to prevent mental illness from 
developing and, barring that, to have early and 
effective intervention strategies that are 
adaptable for each patient. One way to approach 
this goal is to target interventions at the 
developmental trajectory itself, rather than at
 cross-sectional symptoms. Identification of 
deviations from typical trajectories in neurochemical development (e.g., serotonergic 
transmission in autism) may provide a basis 
for interventions targeted toward specific 
developmental periods. The great promise is
 that interventions will guide altered 
developmental trajectories back to a more typi
cal path, diminishing treatment needs in later 
life. 
The results of the NIMH-funded North Amer
ican Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) 
highlight the potential of clinical epidemiology in predicting which youth are more or less 
likely to develop schizophrenia (Addington, et
 al., 2007). Youth who 
are going to develop 
psychosis can be identified before their illness becomes full-blown 35 percent of the time, if 
they meet widely accepted criteria for risk. Th
e NAPLS study shows that this figure rises to 
between 65 and 80 percent if youth have certain combinations of risk factors: deteriorating 
social functioning; family history of psychosis 
paired with recent decline in ability to 
function; increase in unusual thoughts; increase in suspicion/paranoia; and, past or current 
drug abuse. Knowing what these risk factors 
are—particularly combin
ations of them—can 
help scientists predict who is likely to devel
op the illnesses within two to three years with 
the same accuracy that other kinds of risk fa
ctors can predict major medical diseases, such 
as diabetes. This type of work will be critical to early identification, and possible 
prevention or early intervention in at-risk individuals with complex mental illness.

## Summaries

### Uddin et al 2010

## General Findings
* As brains develop activity trends from being more diffuse to more focal.
* Motor systems precede higher cognition

* Infants and Young Children
 * ROI seed-based analyses
  * Sedating participants- used in exceptional cases only.
  * Natural sleep is an alternative to sedation. 
  * Age range is normally difficult to obtain data from (motion)
  * Percentage of brain volume with connectivity and strength of connections increases non-uniformly between 2 weeks and 1 year.
  * Connectivity in sensorimotor areas precedes visual network connectivity.
 * ICA
  * Data driven approach for decomposing brains into ROIs
  * ICA identifies 5 networks in sleeping infants under 1: primary visual, somatosensory and motor, temporal/inferior parietal cortex, poasterior lateral/midline parietal, medial/lateral anterior prefrontal
  * No DMN in infants- DMN related to self-related and social cognition
  * Intrahemispheric connectivity > interhemispheric connectivity for infants; local circuits precedes global connectivity
 * Graph/network analysis
  * Adult brains have small-world architecture
  * A PCC/Rsp (retrosplenial) node is consistently observed to have high centrality measures across ages.
  * MPFC starts to become a hub at around age 1.
 
* Adolescents and Young Adults
 * ROI seed-based analyses
  * 7-9 year olds have decreased connectivity on anterior-posterior span, vmPFC-PCC
  * 7-9 yo still have sparsely connected DMN, but adult interhemispheric connectivity according to comparison of correlation matrices
 * ICA-based analyses
  * Aging --> stronger within-network connections, more pruned between-network connections; two-way causality decreases with age; Granger causality
 * Graph/network analysis
  * "Segregation" (decrease in connectivity) in spatially close regions, "integration" (increase in connectivity) between distant regions occur with aging
  * Local architecture in kids --> distributed architecture in adults
  * More segregation in children, more integration in adults at whole-brain level
  * Overall, sub-networks of densely-connected nodes; small-world architecture in both 7-9 yo and 19-22 yo

* Neurodevelopmental Disorders
 * ADHD
  * Decreases in - correlations between anterio cingulate and precuneus/PCC
  * Dcreases in connectivity between precuneus and DMN
 * ASD
  * Overall reduced DMN connectivity
  * Repetitive behaviors correlated with connectivity between PCC and parahippocampal gyrus
  * Adolescents with ASD have weaker DMN connectivity than adults with ASD
 * Other disorders
  * BDNF gene variants affect connectivity


## Considerations/Future Directions
* Are differences noted due to individual performance differences or due to brain maturation?  Must tease apart within-subject effects and age-related effects.
* Motion - potential solutions
 * Mock scanner
 * Artifact correction
 * ICA
* Nonstandard instructions for rsfMRI
 * Close eyes
 * Fixation
 * No fixation
* Do "rest blocks" in task block designs accurately reflect non-task rs data?
* How reproducible are networks in developing participants?
 * DMN is very reproducible, non-DMN not so much
* Statistical Power and Sampling
 * Power calculations should be done
 * Clinical and control groups should be homogeneous
* Nuisance corrections
* Could integrate DTI w/ rsfMRI.
* Could integrate genetics data with rsfMRI.
