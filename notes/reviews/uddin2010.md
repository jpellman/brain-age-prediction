# Notes on "Typical and atypical development of functional human brain networks: insights from resting-state fMRI", Uddin et al., Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, 2010

## General Findings
* As brains develop activity trends from being more diffuse to more focal.
* Motor systems precede higher cognition

## Infants and Young Children
* ROI seed-based analyses
 * Sedating participants- used in exceptional cases only.
 * Natural sleep is an alternative to sedation. 
 * Age range is normally difficult to obtain data from (motion)
 * Percentage of brain volume with connectivity and strength of connections increases non-uniformly between 2 weeks and 1 year.
 * Connectivity in sensorimotor areas precedes visual network connectivity.
* ICA
 * Data driven approach for decomposing brains into ROIs
 * ICA identifies 5 networks in sleeping infants under 1: primary visual, somatosensory and motor, temporal/inferior parietal cortex, poasterior lateral/midline parietal, medial/lateral anterior prefrontal
 * No DMN in infants- DMN related to self-related and social cognition
 * Intrahemispheric connectivity > interhemispheric connectivity for infants; local circuits precedes global connectivity
* Graph/network analysis
 * Adult brains have small-world architecture
 * A PCC/Rsp (retrosplenial) node is consistently observed to have high centrality measures across ages.
 * MPFC starts to become a hub at around age 1.
 
## Adolescents and Young Adults
* ROI seed-based analyses
 * 7-9 year olds have decreased connectivity on anterior-posterior span, vmPFC-PCC
 * 7-9 yo still have sparsely connected DMN, but adult interhemispheric connectivity according to comparison of correlation matrices
* ICA-based analyses
 * Aging --> stronger within-network connections, more pruned between-network connections; two-way causality decreases with age; Granger causality
* Graph/network analysis
 * "Segregation" (decrease in connectivity) in spatially close regions, "integration" (increase in connectivity) between distant regions occur with aging
 * Local architecture in kids --> distributed architecture in adults
 * More segregation in children, more integration in adults at whole-brain level
 * Overall, sub-networks of densely-connected nodes; small-world architecture in both 7-9 yo and 19-22 yo

## Neurodevelopmental Disorders
* ADHD
 * Decreases in - correlations between anterio cingulate and precuneus/PCC
 * Dcreases in connectivity between precuneus and DMN
* ASD
 * Overall reduced DMN connectivity
 * Repetitive behaviors correlated with connectivity between PCC and parahippocampal gyrus
 * Adolescents with ASD have weaker DMN connectivity than adults with ASD
* Other disorders
 * BDNF gene variants affect connectivity

## Considerations/Future Directions
* Are differences noted due to individual performance differences or due to brain maturation?  Must tease apart within-subject effects and age-related effects.
* Motion - potential solutions
 * Mock scanner
 * Artifact correction
 * ICA
* Nonstandard instructions for rsfMRI
 * Close eyes
 * Fixation
 * No fixation
* Do "rest blocks" in task block designs accurately reflect non-task rs data?
* How reproducible are networks in developing participants?
 * DMN is very reproducible, non-DMN not so much
* Statistical Power and Sampling
 * Power calculations should be done
 * Clinical and control groups should be homogeneous
* Nuisance corrections
* Could integrate DTI w/ rsfMRI.
* Could integrate genetics data with rsfMRI.
