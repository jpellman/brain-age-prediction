# Notes on "The development of Human Functional Brain Networks", Power et al., Neuron, 2010

* Main contention: Graph theory can be using to analyze functional resting-state networks.
* Hitherto findings:
 * 1-4 yo have correaltions between visual cortex and other occipital cortex voxels
 * 30 week olds have bilateral activity in auditory and somatosensory cortices ( Redcay et al 2007), (Lin et al 2008, Smyser et al 2010)
 * Midline areas gain connectivity earlier than lateral (Smyser et al 2010)
 * Somatosensory develops faster than visual (Lin et al 2008)
 * ICA identifies 5 networks in sedated infants: primary visual, somatosensory and motor, temporal/inferior parietal cortex, poasterior lateral/midline parietal, medial/lateral anterior prefrontal (Fransson et al 2007); replicated in sleeping infants (Fransson et al 2009)
 * Fair et al (2008): Anterior-posterior correlations in kids connected MPFC/superior frontal nodes to lateral parietal and PCC / retrosplenial nodes.
 * Kelly et al (2009): Several cohorts.  Youngest cohort had diffuse correlations near seeds / not many long-distance correlations.  With progress, correlations close to seeds weakened and long-distance correlations became stronger.  Found no anterior-posterior correlations in youngest, but this increased with age.
 * DMN ICA studies
  * Increasing partial correlations between PCC and MPFC over development.
 * Generally:
  * No DMN in kids, and no frontal/parietal coactivation.
  * MPFC-PCC coactivation develops over time (Smyser et al., 2010; Supekar et al 2010)
  * Distributed components in kids might resemble DMN.
  * No anterior-posterior correlations in 9-13 yo; this increases with time.
  * DMN correlation strength increases with development.
  * Children have a default-like region in the PCC. (Thomason et al 2008; Supekar et al 2010)
* Graph theoretic studies:
 * Short distance edges are strong in kids; weak in adults; long distance are weak in kids, strong in adults
 * Increases in edge strength occur between functionally related regions (i.e., parts of the DMN)
 * Small-world networks are present at all ages.
 * Connectivity in children is largely a function of anatomical closeness; in adults connectivity is defined more by functional closeness.
 * Efficiency occurs at local and global levels across all ages.
 * Node studies:
  * Fransson et al (2010) attempted defining hubs by using voxelwise graph analyses.  Adults have DMN hubs, children have sensorimotor hubs.  Degree/between centrality hubs were similar for all ages.
  * Gao et al (2009) also strove to identify hubs using 6,7,13,19 nodes in neonates,1 yo, 2 yo and adults.
  * Nodes are hard to define because they aren't obvious.
