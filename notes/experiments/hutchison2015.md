# Notes on "Tracking the Brainâ€™s Functional Coupling Dynamics over Development", Hutchison & Morton, Journal of Neuroscience, 2015

* Functional states were present across all ages, but the frequency/pattern of expression differed.
* As you age, there is more neurophysiological noise and more complex responses to external stimulation.
* Shift in location of hubs from sensorimotor to heteromodal cortex (Fransson et al 2011)
* Two predictions:
 1. Age-related differences in when whole-brain connectivity states were expressed.
 2. Inter-regional connnectivity would be more complex in older people.
* Methods
 * Children received mock scanner training to reduce motion.
 * Rest and task conditions; task = stimulus-response compatibility
 * ICA performed
 * States were detected through a cluster analysis; 12 states that occurred in all individuals found.  5 states unique to certain participants.
  * Four measures of connectivity state expression:
   1. frequency - the proportion of windows of time when a participant was in a particular state to all windows of time
   2. mean dwell time (MDT) - average number of consecutive windows where participant is in the same state
   3. intertransition interval (ITI) - number of consecutive instances of a state before transition to a new state
   4. number of transitions - raw number of all state transitions in both rest and task

## Results
 * Number of states expressed at rest uncorrelated w/ age.
 * Number of states expressed in a task positively correlated w/ age.
 * Frequency
  * Age negatively associated w/ states I,F,G; positively associated w/ B and C.
 * MDT
  * Age positively associated w/ MDT of states H,D,C; negatively with state I.
 * ITI
  * Age negatively associated during task.
  * Older folks transitioned between states more quickly during task.
 * Number of transitions
  * Age positively associated during task.
  * More state transitions during task for older folks.
 * More network coupling variability at rest for adults
 * Less network coupling variability during task for adults
* Conclusions
 * Older folks have more complex dynamics when given a task.
