# Notes on "Development of Large-Scale Functional Brain Networks in Children", Supekar et al, PLoS Biology, 2009

* A large variety of network analyses were run on two groups- 7-9 yo and 19-22 yo; this study seemed very exploratory.
 * Path Length
 * Clustering Coefficient
 * Small-worldness
 * Global efficiency
 * SVM Classifier
 * Hierarchy
 * Corroborating evidence from DTI
 * Wavelet decomposition.

* Findings
 * Path length, clustering coefficient, and small-worldness were not different overall between groups.
 * No differences in global efficiency were observed between groups.
 * The SVM classifier reliably differentiated scans from the two groups.
 * The adult networks exhibited more hierarchy.
 * Using 5 regions (association, limbic, paralimbic, primary, subcortical) as nodes:
  * Between regions
   * In subcortical region, path length and clustering coefficient were lower, degree and efficiency were higher.
  * Within regions
   * No differences between groups
 * Using 90 ROIs
  * 6/8 subcortical regions were different between groups
 * Subcortical areas had increased connectivity w/ primary sensory,association and paralimbic regions in kids.
 * Older group had greater connectivity paralambic and limbic/association areas, and between limbic association areas.
 * :. Greater subcortical connectivity in kids; greater paralimbic connectivity in adults
 * Calculated "wiring distance" between 5 regions using DTI scans.  Taken w/ functional connectivity results, close regions were higher in connectivity in kids, distant regions were higher in connectivity for adults.
